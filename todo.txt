- FHIRPath
  - Add R6 support in fhirpath-lab.com
  - FHIRPath Lab Debugger support

- SQL On FHIR
  - Support the group parameter on $run

- My CapabilityStatement for $run needs help - name, and unsure about operation vs. resource

- Test to see if invalid attributes in the FHIR JSON model are allowed/disallowed?

- Async index for transactions

- We don't yet declare US Core profile support in Capability Statement - we need to figure out an approach to know if we can depending on the backend support features turned on/off

- Data issues with some of the Inferno tests still
